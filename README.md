Placeholder for data ideas

Been thinking a lot about how data can be used to represent Austin- and highlight things that other pre-drawn maps might obscure. It would be great to connect with critical geography folks, people who know more about GIS. 

Goal: Create an app or some type of interface with Austin open data- so people can organize across partisan divides.
  Mini-goals:
    Document effects of policy on people's lives.
    Push notifications/text for new organizers (e.g., scripts for phone calls/door knocking)
    Allow to upload multimedia for collecting stories a/t policy
    Geocaching and location-based options (not enabled by default) to tie location to multimedia
    Connect user with nearby groups
      If someone is visiting from outside of Austin, the app should still be able to suggest nearest group
    Connect user with similarly-focused groups (e.g., cause-based, ethnoracial-based, policy-based)
    Events Calendar (with notifications- based on tag or type) - Aspirational
      Rallies, Protest, March, Conference Call, Phone banking, Letter-writing, Community meal, Meet & Greet - all possible tags for events
      Location AND type based
      Integration w/ Google Calendar may be an option to consider for this
    Allow easy connection to social media
      Full integration would be nice- maybe even with openIDs- but
      Even having just an easy screenshot tool that would allow people to post online through whatever social media tool they use would work
    Allow easy way to see voting records and other public info- perhaps by simply linking to a website like ProPublica
